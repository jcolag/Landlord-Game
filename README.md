The Landlord Game
=================

This will be a growing project, an implementation of Lizzy Magie's Landlord's Game, a public domain, patent-expired, trademark-free precursor to a certain board game produced by an owner that tries to maintain a...well, _monopoly_ on its business.

Usage
-----

1. Build.

2. Run.

3. Play.

There isn't enough game to have instructions outside of the prompting.

Build
-----

It definitely works in MonoDevelop.  It almost certainly works in SharpDevelop.  It probably works in Visual Studio, maybe with some fudging.

Obviously, that needs testing.

Status
------

Currently, it's not a very fun game, unless you get weirdly excited about buying and renting places.  It's just a console application that understands players and game boards.

Give it time.
